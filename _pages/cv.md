Education
======
* MMath in Combinatorics & Optimization (Quantum Information), University of Waterloo, 2017-2019
* B.Sc. in Physics, Adam Mickiewicz University, 2015-2017
* B.Eng. in Computing, Poznan University of Technology, 2013-2017


Work experience
======
* 2019-now: Associate Software Engineer at TomTom
  * Part of the unit working on high quality 3D maps for autonomous driving.
  * Technical leader and software engineer in a Java project on calculating worldwide positional corrections due to continental drifts for maps. Made major contributions to system design, developed mathematical models and implemented core algorithms. Successfully delivered a related proof-of-concept solution for a major automotive brand.
  * Designed and implemented quality metrics in Java that helped managers choose efficient and accurate smoothing algorithm for a trajectory smoothing product.
  * Initiated an interoffice collaboration on a quantum computing project. Involved a quantum research team of another major IT company. Delivered a presentation on use cases of quantum computers in autonomous driving to about 60 engineers.

* 2017-2019: Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo (Institute for Quantum Computing)
  * Duties: research on the embezzlement of entanglement and entanglement dilution
  * Supervisor: Professor Debbie Leung
  
* Jun-Aug 2017: Research Intern at the National University of Singapore (Centre for Quantum Technologies)
