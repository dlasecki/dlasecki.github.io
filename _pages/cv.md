Work experience
======
* 2019-now: Associate Software Engineer at [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/)
  * Part of the unit working on high quality 3D maps for autonomous driving.
  * Technical leader and software engineer in a Java project on calculating worldwide positional corrections due to continental drifts for maps. Made major contributions to system design, developed mathematical models and implemented core algorithms. Successfully delivered a related proof-of-concept solution for a major automotive brand.
  * Designed and implemented quality metrics in Java that helped managers choose efficient and accurate smoothing algorithm for a trajectory smoothing product.
  * Initiated an interoffice collaboration on a quantum computing project. Involved a quantum research team of another major IT company. Delivered a presentation on use cases of quantum computers in autonomous driving to about 60 engineers.
