My research interests include:

## 1. Quantum entanglement theory.

Interested in fundamental properties of quantum entanglement as well as entanglement as a resource in communication scenarios. My Masters thesis considered the embezzlement of entanglement and contributed a noisy version of this protocol and applications to the dilution of entanglement - a fundamental protocol in entanglement theory.

## 2. Quantum communication theory.

Interested in fundamental limits of quantum transmission, especially capacities of quantum channels, and non-classical phenomena that emerge in this setting, e.g. superactivation of quantum channel capacities.

## 3. Quantum algorithms theory.

Interested in theoretical limits of quantum computers, development of quantum algorithms and using existing quantum algorithms to solve domain-specific problems. Currently exploring applications of quantum computers in autonomous driving.

## 4. Optimization theory and applications.
