Interested in theoretical limits of quantum computers, development of quantum algorithms and using existing quantum algorithms to solve domain-specific problems. Recipient of the <a href="https://unitary.fund/">Unitary Fund</a> grant to implement the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028">Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</a> in Q# in a hybrid approach with a classical optimizer. Currently exploring applications of quantum computers in autonomous driving.

## 2. Quantum entanglement.

Interested in fundamental properties of quantum entanglement as well as entanglement as a resource in communication scenarios. My <a href="https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14682">Master's thesis</a> considered the embezzlement of entanglement and contributed a noisy version of this protocol and applications to the dilution of entanglement - a fundamental protocol in entanglement theory.

## 3. Quantum communication.

Interested in fundamental limits of quantum transmission, especially capacities of quantum channels, and non-classical phenomena that emerge in this setting, e.g. superactivation of quantum channel capacities. In my [Bachelor's thesis](http://dlasecki.github.io/files/thesis.pdf), I contributed new insights on the problem of determining the assisted quantum capacity of the quantum depolarizing channel.

## 4. Optimization theory and applications.

Interested in formulating various problems as optimization tasks and using optimization theory to reason about them. In my theses, I used linear optimization in the context of embezzlement of entanglement and semidefinite and linear optimization in the context of the capacity of the quantum depolarizing channel.
