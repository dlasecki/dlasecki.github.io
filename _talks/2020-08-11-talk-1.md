QAOA is a quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Its sucessful execution depends on input parameters that need to be tailored to a specific problem that we are solving. Usually, this choice is challenging for a user and might require a trial and error approach. The problem can be mitigated by using a classical feedback loop that involves a classical optimizer that searches for good input parameters. I will present my implementation of such a hybrid QAOA algorithm in Q# and C# taht uses a gradient-free Cobyla optimizer and I will show how to solve a simple problem using it.
