title: "Hypercontractivity Via the Entropy Method"
collection: materials
permalink: /materials/hypercontractive
excerpt: 'In this project I present a detailed proof of a hypercontractive inequality using basic entropic quantities and their properties. The proof comes from the paper [*Hypercontractivity Via the Entropy Method*](https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v009a029/v009a029.pdf) by Blais and Tan.'
