In classical information theory channel capacities are additive. Is it the case in quantum information theory as well? Can we transmit any information by combining quantum channels which alone have no capacity? This project summarizes a paper [*Quantum Communication With Zero-Capacity Channels*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4935) by Graeme Smith and Jon Yard that answers these questions.
