title: "Lower bound on PPT distillable entanglement from isotropic states"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rains
excerpt: 'Quantum entanglement is an essential resource in quantum information theory. What is the rate of distillation of entanglement from isotropic states using operations that are positive-partial-transpose-preserving? This project presents a detailed proof of a theorem from the paper [*A semidefinite program for distillable entanglement*](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008047) by Rains that shows a lower bound for this rate. The problem is equivalent to the rate of transmission through a quantum depolarizing channel assisted by PPTp codes.'
