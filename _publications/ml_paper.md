title: "Classical Machine Learning for Quantum Systems and
Quantum Enhanced Machine Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ml_paper
excerpt: 'What is *Quantum Machine Learning*? We may use classical machine learning to solve problems in quantum physics or we may use quantum algorithms to develop new, fully quantum machine learning techniques. I chose a paper from both categories and summarized them in my project. The first paper is [*A Neural Decoder for Topological Codes*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04238) by Giacomo Torlai, Roger G. Melko which proposes a stochastic neural network to create decoders for topological quantum error-correction codes. The second paper is [*Quantum Perceptron Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04799) by Nathan Wiebe, Ashish Kapoor, Krysta M Svore which shows how to quantumly represent and train a perceptron.'
